Of course. This is an excellent candidate for refactoring. The original code is a "single-file monolith," which is great for a quick prototype but becomes difficult to manage, read, and extend as the project grows.

Here is a breakdown of how I would restructure the code, focusing on the principles of **Separation of Concerns**, **Modularity**, and **Reusability**.

### Core Refactoring Philosophy

The main goal is to separate the distinct parts of the application into their own modules (files and folders). The key concerns in this code are:

1.  **Core Logic/Engine:** The non-rendering, pure JavaScript `VoxelVisibility` class and its algorithms. This is the "model" of the application.
2.  **3D Rendering:** The Three.js scene setup and object management. This is the "view."
3.  **UI Components:** The React components for user controls and information display.
4.  **State Management & Application Glue:** The main `App` component that holds the state and connects everything. This is the "controller."
5.  **Reusable Logic (Hooks):** Repetitive React logic (like the animation loop or FPS counter) can be extracted into custom hooks.
6.  **Utilities:** Generic helper functions (like vector math).

### Proposed File Structure

A clean, modern React project structure would look something like this:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/
│   │   ├── Controls.js
│   │   ├── StatsDisplay.js
│   │   └── AnimationControls.js
│   └── VoxelScene.js
│
├── core/
│   ├── VoxelVisibility.js
│   └── utils.js
│
├── hooks/
│   ├── useAnimationLoop.js
│   └── useFpsCounter.js
│
├── App.js         // The main application component
└── index.js       // Entry point, renders App
```

---

### Explanation of the Restructuring

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what code would go where and why.

#### 1. The Core Logic: `src/core/`

This directory holds the "brains" of the application—the parts that could theoretically run in any JavaScript environment (like Node.js), not just in a browser with React.

*   **`core/VoxelVisibility.js`**:
    *   This file would contain the entire `VoxelVisibility` class.
    *   It is the core engine for all visibility calculations. It has no dependencies on React or Three.js, which is a great design that should be preserved and emphasized by placing it in its own module.
    *   It would export the `VoxelVisibility` class.

*   **`core/utils.js`**:
    *   This file would contain generic helper functions.
    *   The `rotateVectorY` function is a perfect candidate. It's a pure mathematical utility.
    *   If more math functions were needed (e.g., vector normalization, dot product), they would also live here. This keeps the `VoxelVisibility` class focused on its main task and outsources generic calculations.

#### 2. Reusable React Logic: `src/hooks/`

This directory is for custom React Hooks, which are a powerful way to extract and reuse stateful logic from components.

*   **`hooks/useAnimationLoop.js`**:
    *   The animation logic currently inside the `App` component (`useEffect` with `requestAnimationFrame`) would be extracted into this hook.
    *   It would manage the `isAnimating` state and the `requestAnimationFrame` loop.
    *   A possible signature could be: `useAnimationLoop(callback, isAnimating, speed)`. The hook would call the `callback` function on every frame when `isAnimating` is true.
    *   This cleans up the `App` component significantly and makes the animation logic reusable.

*   **`hooks/useFpsCounter.js`**:
    *   The FPS calculation logic (the `fpsTimeRef` and `fpsCountRef` inside `App`) would move here.
    *   This hook would encapsulate the logic of counting frames over time and would simply return the current FPS.
    *   The `App` component would then just call `const fps = useFpsCounter();` to get the value, making it much more declarative.

#### 3. Presentation Layer: `src/components/`

This is for all the React components. I've further subdivided it into a `ui` folder for simple, presentational components and the main `VoxelScene` component.

*   **`components/ui/Controls.js`**:
    *   This would be the existing `Controls` component. It's a "dumb" component that just takes props (`cone`, `onConeChange`) and renders UI. No changes needed other than moving it to its own file.

*   **`components/ui/StatsDisplay.js`**:
    *   The existing `StatsDisplay` component. Again, just move it to its own file.

*   **`components/ui/AnimationControls.js`**:
    *   The block of JSX in `App` that contains the "Show/Hide Rays" button, "Start/Stop Rotation" button, and the speed slider would be extracted into its own component.
    *   This further cleans up the `App` component's render method.

*   **`components/VoxelScene.js`**:
    *   This remains a large and complex component, but its responsibilities would be narrowed.
    *   **Scene Setup:** The initial `useEffect` for setting up the scene, camera, renderer, and mouse controls is complex. For an even more advanced refactor, this setup boilerplate could itself be moved into a custom hook like `useThreeScene(mountRef)`.
    *   **Object Updates:** The `useEffect` hooks for updating voxels, the cone, and rays would remain here. Their job is to translate application state (`visibleVoxels`, `cone`) into Three.js objects.
    *   This component's sole focus becomes **visualizing data in a 3D space**. It receives all the data it needs via props and doesn't contain any business logic or application state itself.

#### 4. The Orchestrator: `src/App.js`

After refactoring, the `App.js` component becomes much cleaner and easier to understand. Its role is to be the central "conductor."

*   **State Management:** It would still hold the primary application state using `useState` (`cone`, `showRays`, `visibleVoxels`, etc.).
*   **Logic Execution:** It would initialize the `VoxelVisibility` instance. The main `useEffect` that calls `visibility.current.getVisibleVoxelsInCone(...)` would remain here, as this is the core application logic that connects the cone state to the visible voxel state.
*   **Hook Usage:** It would use the custom hooks:
    *   `const fps = useFpsCounter();`
    *   `useAnimationLoop(rotateConeCallback, isAnimating, rotationSpeed);`
*   **Component Composition:** Its `return` statement would be very simple and declarative, composing the other components together and passing down the necessary state and callbacks as props.

```jsx
// A simplified view of the new App.js render method
return (
  <div className="w-full h-screen relative ...">
    <VoxelScene
      visibility={visibility.current}
      cone={cone}
      showRays={showRays}
      visibleVoxels={visibleVoxels}
    />
    <Controls
      cone={cone}
      onConeChange={setCone}
      rayCount={rayCount}
    />
    <StatsDisplay
      visibleCount={visibleVoxels.length}
      totalVoxels={obstacleCount}
      fps={fps}
    />
    <AnimationControls
      isAnimating={isAnimating}
      onToggleAnimation={() => setIsAnimating(!isAnimating)}
      // ... other props
    />
    {/* ... other minor UI elements */}
  </div>
);
```

### Summary of Benefits

This refactoring would result in:

*   **Readability:** Each file has a single, clear responsibility.
*   **Maintainability:** It's much easier to find and fix bugs or add features when code is logically organized. Want to change the cone controls? Go to `Controls.js`. Need to tweak the raycasting algorithm? Go to `VoxelVisibility.js`.
*   **Reusability:** Custom hooks (`useAnimationLoop`, `useFpsCounter`) and UI components can be easily reused elsewhere. The core `VoxelVisibility` engine is completely decoupled and could be used in a different project.
*   **Scalability:** This structure can easily accommodate new features (e.g., different types of obstacles, multiple light sources, a more complex UI) without making any single file unmanageably large.
